#Reality Sports

##What is it?
Reality Sports is a Ruby On Rails-based web app to be used in conjunction with live NFL games.  The app provides a points wagering system in concurrence with real-time game updates and includes such features as a global leaderboard, a game chat window, and a simple user registration process that can be done natively or through a valid Facebook account.

##Why is it useful?
The creators of Reality Sports, Ricky and Dave, are hardcore football fans that will watch any game at any time.  The majority of football fans are not as crazed and tend to follow their favorite team and favorite players.  Reality Sports is meant to connect the casual fan to games they might not otherwise watch, while keeping the more devout fans satiated as well.

##Why Reality Sports?
We love fantasy sports, but the harsh reality of fantasy football is what inspired us to make this product.  No longer will a pre-season injury derail your entire season nor will some poor choices you made on draft night ruin your shot to enjoy the final weeks of the season.  Reality Sports allows you to pick the games in which you wish to participate, as many or as few as you like.  Going away for a weekend?  No problem.  Place your bets before you leave and we'll take care of the rest.
